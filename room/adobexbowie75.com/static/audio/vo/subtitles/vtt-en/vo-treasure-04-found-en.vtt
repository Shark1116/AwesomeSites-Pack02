00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
David Bowie was 1.78m tall 

00:03.500 --> 00:06.000
but that wasn’t actually Ziggy Stardust’s height. 

00:06.500 --> 00:09.000
Ziggy could be 2 metres tall, or 

00:09.200 --> 00:12.500
whatever size his platform boots allowed him to be that night. 

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
The boots looked expensive but they acually weren’t, 

00:16.500 --> 00:21.500
since Bowie chose to substitute a £25 pair of Yamamoto originals 

00:22.000 --> 00:24.500
with an £8 pair of plastic copies.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
In any case, Ziggy’s stage presence more than made up for his knock-off boots.
